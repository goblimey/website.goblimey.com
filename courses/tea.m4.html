<h2>How the British Fell in Love With Tea</h2>

<p>
	The British have been drinking tea since the seventeenth Century,
	in those days importing it from China at great expense.
	Later, the East India Company decided to create their own tea plantations in India,
	but they had no suitable tea plants and didn't know how to turn the raw plants into tea.
	What followed is a tale of drug pushing, industrial espionage, smuggling and good old British incompetence.
