<h2>Alan Turing</h2>
<h3>Computing Pioneer, War Hero and Gay Icon</h3>

<p>
	During the corona virus pandemic lockdown the Surrey History Meetup
	is running a series of online talks on all sorts of subjects
	related to Surrey History.
	For details of all the talks,
	see <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Surrey-History-Meetup/'>here</a>
</p>
<p>
	Background notes for the Alan Turing talk can be downloaded
	<a href='alan.turing.pdf'>here</a>.
	These also contain links to some useful videos.
</p>
<p>
	Dr Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a theoretical mathematician and inventor.
	His parents lived in Guildford from 1927 and he visited there regularly throughout his life.
</p>
<p>
	In 1936 Turing described the Turing Machine, a programmable computing device. Theoretical at the time,
	it's the prototype of all modern computers.
</p>
<p>
	Turing worked as a system designer at Bletchley Park,
	notably designing the "bombe",
	an electro-mechanical device used to break messages encrypted
	by the German Enigma machine.
	Turing's work at Bletchley
	is thought to have shortened the Second World War by several years.
	Unfortunately this didn't become public
	until long after his conviction for homosexual acts
	and his death in 1954.
</p>
<p>
	The atmosphere at Bletchley Park during the War
	was portrayed in Robert Harris' novel
	Enigma.
	The film of the book was produced by rock star Mick Jagger,
	who also funded a rebuild of Turing's "bombe"
	as a working prop.
	Jagger's bombe is now on display at the Bletchley Park Museum.
</p>
<p>
	Turing was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in the 2014 film The Imitation Game.
	Sadly, that film is a travesty of the real story of his life.
</p>
<p>
	The speaker Simon Ritchie is a software engineer and
	his entire career has depended on the computer systems that Turing pioneered.
</p>
<p>
	Turing did research in many fields in his short life and
	any talk about him will get into subjects that are technically difficult.
	The background notes and videos should help.
