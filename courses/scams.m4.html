<h2>Scams that Broke the Economy</h2>
<p>
    There are many schemes
    run by fraudsters
    to part people from their money,
    but some are so successful
    that they do serious damage to the whole economy.
</p>
<p>
    Simon Ritchie's talk covers a number of these scams
    and shows that they all have
    some common themes,
    in particular a piece of magic technology
    that few people understand
    and which promises unlimited wealth.
