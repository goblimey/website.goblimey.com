<h2>Scams that Broke the Economy</h2>
<p>
    There are many financial schemes
    run by fraudsters
    to part people from their money,
    but some schemes are so successful
    that they do serious damage to the whole economy.
    The South Sea Bubble that burst in 1720 is a good example,
    as is the sub-prime mortgage boom that led to the 2008 crash.

<p>
    Simon Ritchie's talk covers a number of these scams,
    concentrating on some common themes,
    in particular a piece of magic technology
    that few people understand
    and which promises unlimited wealth.
