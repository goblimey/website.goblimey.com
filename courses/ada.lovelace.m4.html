<h3>Ada lovelace</h3>
<h4>The Countess Who Invented Computer Programming</h4>
<p>
	Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852)
	was married to William King,
	Earl Lovelace.
	They lived in Surrey and
	commissioned the building of Horsley Towers,
	a magnificent gothic mansion
	near Guildford.
</p>
<p>
	The Cambridge mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage
	designed a number
	of mechanical calculating devices
	including the Analaytical Engine.
	He never managed to get his machine working,
	but versions have been built since.
	<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMy4vSZ-J_I/'>This video</a> explains the principles:
	Had he succeeded,
	the Engine would have been the first programmable digital computer.
</p>
<p>
	Countess Lovelace was
	one of few women trained in mathematics at the time.
	She was also the first of many women
	to do pioneering work in Computer Science.
	She worked with Babbage to promote his ideas
	and published the first real computer program,
	about 100 years before the first digital computer existed.
