<h2>Courses</h2>
<h3>UNIX and Linux self-teaching software</h3>
<p>

	Learn is Computer-Based Teaching software
	that gives basic training in using commands on UNIX and Linux.
	(Linux is a version of UNIX.)
	The learn software is free and
	you can run it on a Windows PC,
	so you can learn to use a UNIX system before you have
	access to one.
</p>
<p>
	You will find the instructions for setting up and running
	the learn software
	<a href="/projects/learn/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Once you have completed the learn courses,
	you can hire a cloud server running
	Linux for as little as $5 per month
	as described <a href="/projects/webserver/index.html/">here</a>.
