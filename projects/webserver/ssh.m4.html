<h2>SSH Authentication Keys</h2>
<p>
	To access your server securely, you need ssh keys.
	These are just two plain text files stored on your local machine,
	one public and one private.
	They're called keys because your droplet will be locked
	and only somebody with the keys can get in.
	You need to set up some keys before you create your droplet.
	I believe that you can set up keys on a smartphone,
	but I never have.
	Here I assume that you are using a laptop or desktop computer.
</p>
<p>
	If you use a Mac
	<a
		href='https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-mac-os-x'>
		see this document</a>.
	I believe that Windows from version 10 onwards
	has the necessary software,
	otherwise use the instructions in
	<a
		href='https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows'>
		this page</a>.
	It suggests two options, PuTTY and Git Bash.
	I suggest you use the Git Bash option,
	and in these notes
	I will assume that you have.
</p>
<p>
	If you take the defaults when you create your keys,
	they will be created in a directory called <b>.ssh</b>
	in your home directory.
	You will produce files in there called
	<b>id_rsa</b> (your private key)
	and <b>id_rsa.pub</b> (your public key).
	You need to keep the contents of the private key file to yourself,
	but it's safe to let anyone see the contents of your public key.
	That's the essential idea - nobody else
	knows what's in your private key file
	but anybody can know what's in your public key file.
	The private key is password protected.
	You need to supply the password to use it.
</p>
<p>
	First, check that you haven't already created a pair of key files
	months or years ago,
	and forgotten.
	In your command window, type
</p>
<pre>
    ls ~/.ssh
    ls: cannot access '/home/simon/.ssh': No such file or directory
	</pre>
<p>
	If the ls command lists some files,
	check that
	<b>id_rsa</b> and
	<b>id_rsa.pub</b>
	are not already present.
	If they are,
	you already have what you need.
</p>
<p>
	Create your keys using the <b>ssh_keygen</b> command.
	On a Mac, start a terminal and run the command in that.
	I believe that this command is now standard in Windows,
	so you can run it in a command window.
	(To start a command window,
	type "cmd" in the search bar at the bottom of the screen
	and double click on the black icon that appears.)
	If not, run it
	in a Git Bash window.
</p>
<p>
	In all cases, run the command like so:
</p>
<pre>
    ssh_keygen
	</pre>

The command will take you through creating the files.
To create <b>id_rsa</b> and
<b>id_rsa.pub</b>,
just follow the default actions.
You can choose another name when you create your keys
but it make things a bit easier if you stick to the defaults.
As you will see, you will need these key files
when you create your server.
</p>

<p>
	The files contain
	encryption keys.
	If you take a piece of text and encrypt it using your private key,
	somebody else can use the matching public key
	to decrypt it.
</p>
<p>
	You can use the keys to <b>authenticate</b> yourself - verify your identity.
	It goes something like this:
	We meet up and you give me a copy of your public key file.
	We agree a piece of text,
	say "Abracadabra".
	This text is called <b>the challenge</b>.
	Later, you want to send me an email
	which is guaranteed to come from you and not some imposter.
	You encrypt the agreed challenge with your private key
	and put the result
	in the email.
	The encrypted version is a pile of unreadable junk.
	If I can decrypt this junk
	with your public key and the result is "Abracadabra",
	then I know that it was you that sent the email,
	because only your private key can produce the unreadable junk that,
	when decrypted, produces the challenge.
</p>

<p>
	Strictly, I know that the email was sent by somebody
	who has the private key that matches
	the public key that you gave me,
	which is why you need to keep the contents of
	your private key to yourself.
	Also, the scheme only works if we meet up
	so that I know that it was really you that gave me the public key.
	That's called "the key distribution problem."
</p>
<p>
	The same principle can be used to authenticate yourself and
	log in from the computer on your desk
	(the <b>local machine</b>)
	across the Internet
	to the computer you are renting from the hosting company
	(the <b>remote machine</b>).
	As we will see later,
	when you set up your remote machine,
	you supply your public key.
	Under the covers, the authentication procedure goes something like this:
	when you try to log into the remote machine from your local machine,
	behind the scenes
	the two machines agree a challenge.
	Your local computer encrypts the challenge
	using your private key and sends the result
	across the Internet to the remote machine.
	The remote machine decrypts what it receives
	using your public key and
	checks that the decrypted version matches the agreed challenge.
	If so, it lets you log in.
	You still have to supply a password to open your key,
	but it's not sent across the network.
	The Internet is a public medium
	and various people could be monitoring the traffic
	between the two computers,
	but they can only see the encrypted challenge
	and they can't use what they can see to masquerade as you
	and log in to your server.
</p>
<p>
	(The scheme is a bit more complicated than that,
	to prevent
	an eavesdropper simply copying the encrypted
	challenge and reusing it,
	but that's the general idea.)
</p>

<p>
	The key mechanism allows you to create users on your
	server that don't have a password
	and can only connect to it using the keys.
	As we will see,
	as soon as you set up your server,
	people will try to log into it using software that guesses passwords.
	If any of your users have passwords,
	however complex,
	the password guessers will succeed eventually.
	Authenticating using keys rather than passwords
	is much more secure.
</p>
<p>
	You can use an SSH key pair
	to authenticate yourself on all sort of systems.
	For example
	<a
		href='https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/'>
		github.com
	</a>.

</p>
<p>
	If you create keys on one computer to access a remote system,
	and you want to connect to it from another computer,
	you have to create a .ssh directory in your home
	directory on the second computer and copy the keys across.
	(Don't forget to set the access permissions -
	the private key should be readable only by you.)
</p>
<p>
	If you overwrite or remove your key files,
	you can't recreate them,
	so you will lose access to whichever system you were using them to connect to.
	It's a good idea to keep a backup copy on a memory stick.
