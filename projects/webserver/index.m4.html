	<h2>Internet Services for Small Organisations</h2>
	<p>
		This document is aimed at small organisation such as local societies
		and small companies,
		and explains
		how to
		set up your own Internet servers.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>server</b> is just a computer connected to the Internet
		with a published name.
		Internet services run on servers.
		Your organisation may be already using Internet servers,
		running on somebody else's infrastructure.
		Companies that build websites often provide the servers that run them.
		This tends to be expensive and restrictive,
		and if the website company goes out of business,
		potentially disastrous.
	<p>
		It's quite cheap these days to run your own servers
		on the Internet,
		and fairly easy.
		There's lots of help out there telling you how to do it.
		The problem is that the help is scattered across 
		a lot of documents in a lot of places
		and each document assumes lots of specialist knowledge.
		My instructions here aim to show the whole process from start to finish.
		Inevitably that makes them look a bit complicated
		but each step is fairly simple and you just need to go through them one by one.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's also details here of issues that you may not need to understand right now.
		Trust me, you will need to understand them one day.
	</p>

	<p>
		I mention a number of companies here, notably Ionos, Namecheap and Digital Ocean. 
		My only commercial relationship with them is as a customer.
		Other similar services are available from other companies
		and you can do your own research to find them.
		If I gain any benefit by recommending a supplier in these instructions,
		I make that clear.
		Also, it will be a supplier that I really do use myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you'll see pretty soon,
		your server runs an operating system called Linux.
		If you've not used Linux before,
		I can offer some help.
		You will find some free training software 
		<a href='/projects/learn/index.html'>here</a>.
		Modern versions of Microsoft Windows can run this software
		so you can learn some Linux commands before spending money on a server.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nerds like me distinguish between <b>The Internet</b>
		which is a network of computers offering services of all sorts,
		and <b>The World-Wide Web</b>
		which is all of the web servers
		connected to that network.
		To put that another way,
		the Internet has web servers connected to it,
		but it also has
		mail servers, instant messaging servers and lots of other stuff.
