<h3>Creating a Web server</h3>
<p>
    This section shows how to set up a web server on your droplet.
    It doesn't cover actually writing web pages.
    That's a very big subject
    and there is already plenty of material about it on the web.
    There are also many good books on the subject
    including David Karlins'
    <i>Building Websites for Dummies</i>
    published by John Wiley.
    This section explains how to configure the web server
    that's already installed on your droplet
    and where to put the pages
    once you've created them.
</p>
<p>
    If you specified Debian when you created your droplet, the Apache web server will already be installed.
    You need to configure it.
</p>
<p>
    From your local machine, log into your server as root:
<pre>
    ssh root@example.com
</pre>
or on Windows:
<pre>
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_root root@example.com
    </pre>

<p>
    In the directory /etc/apache2/sites-available there's a file
    <b>000-default.conf</b>.
    You need to edit it.
    Uncomment the ServerName line and set it to your domain name.
    Add a serverAlias line for your www subdomain.
    Change the ServerAdmin line to contain your email address.
</p>
<p>
    Initially the file starts something like this:
<pre>
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
        #ServerName www.example.com

        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    </pre>
Change it to something like this:
<pre>
        <VirtualHost *:80>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

        ServerName example.com
        ServerAlias www.example.com
        ServerAdmin youremailaddress
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html
</pre>
To write out the changes, see the line at the bottom of the command window -
hold down the ctrl key and type 'o',
hit the enter key to confirm the destination file,
then ctrl and 'x' to quit the editor.
</p>
<p>
    Now you can start the web server:
<pre>
    systemctl start apache2
</pre>
</p>
When Apache is installed,
a standard home page is set up.
You should be able to see it from your web browser by navigating to
your web site - my case to
<b>http://example.com/</b>
<p>
    Having said that, the Chrome web browser no longer likes http pages.
    It will try to use <b>https://example.com/</b> instead,
    which doesn't work yet.
</p>
<h3>Setting up HTML pages</h3>
<p>
    The control file that you edited earlier <b>000-default.conf</b> says that
    the document root is the directory <b>/var/www/html</b>.
    This is where your HTML pages live.
    It contains HTML files.
    and subdirectories containing HTML files.
    Each subdirectory of that should contain a file called <b>index.html</b>.
    For example,
    <b>/var/www/html/index.html</b> is your home page.
    Its URL is <b>http://example.com/</b>
    or <b>http://www.example.com/</b>
</p>
<p>
    Within the document root directory
    the subdirectory names determine the URL of each page.
    If you create a directory <b>/var/www/html/about</b> and a file <b>/var/www/html/about/index.html</b>,
    the URL for that page is <b>http://example.com/about/</b>.
</p>
<p>
    If you create a file <b>/var/www/html/about/us.html</b>,
    its URL is <b>http://example.com/about/us.html</b>
</p>
<p>
    The home page determines which pages can be found.
    If the home page contains a link to <b>http://example.com/about/</b>
    then somebody visiting the site can find that page.
    If that page contains a link to <b>http://example.com/about/us.html</b>,
    then a visitor can find that, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    One way to create web pages is to do it on your local computer
    using your chosen web page writing software
    and then copy the pages across to the web server using the scp command in a command window.
    For example, if your command window is in the <b>about</b> directory
    on your local machine
    and that contains the files
    <b>index.html</b> and <b>us.html</b>,
    and you've already created a directory <b>/var/www/html/about</b>
    on the web server,
    you can copy the files over like so:
<pre>
    scp index.html us.html root@example.com:/var/www/html/about/
</pre>
