		<h2>gRPC</h2>
		<p>
                        gRPC is an open-source Remote Procedure Call mechanism developed by Google.
                        It allows applications written in a range of 
                        well-known programming languages, including Go,
                        to exchange data.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is important to Go developers
			because most of us work in an existing software environment
			written in Java, C# or whatever,
			and anything we write in Go will have to interwork with that.
		<p>
		<p>
			The Go version of the gRPC distribution includes example of clients and servers 
			communicating over a clear-text channel,
			but they don't show how to create an
			encrypted (SSL) channel.
			Encrypted channels are required in many enterprise environments,
			so I enhanced one of Google's examples showing how to do it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The github page for my enhanced example explains how to install
			Protocol Buffers and gRPC.
			It can be found
