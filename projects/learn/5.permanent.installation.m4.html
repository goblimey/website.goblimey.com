<h3>Permanent Installation</h3>

<p>Docker just packages up the compiling and installing of learn.
	If you have a UNIX or Linux system available
	and don't want to bother with Docker,
	you can clone the github repository and install learn permanently like so:</p>
<pre>
    git clone https://github.com/goblimey/learn-unix

    cd learn-unix/learn

    ./configure

    make

    sudo make install
    </pre>

<p>Users of the same computer can then run it like so:
<pre>
    learn files
</pre>
</p>
<p>See the INSTALL file in the learn directory for more complex installations.</p>

<p>There are three programs, learn, lcount and learn.tee. Learn is the front end and the user only needs to find that.
</p>

<p>The lessons are text files. They are stored in the lib directory which contains a directory for each course. Lesson
	3.1a is in the file L3.1a, and so on.</p>

<p>The directory man contains the manual entries in nroff format.
	When running the docker image, type "man learn" to
	read the one for learn.</p>

<p>
	Volume 2 of the version 7 UNIX manual
	contains papers about different aspects of UNIX
	including one by Kernighan and Lesk on the learn system.
	That's available in PDF form from
	<a href="https://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/learn/learn.pdf/">here</a>.
