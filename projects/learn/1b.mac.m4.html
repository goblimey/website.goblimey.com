<h2>Installing Learn on an Apple Mac</h2>


<p>
	You need to install Docker and git.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">installing git</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/">installing Docker</a>
</p>
<p>
	You need to know how to start a command window.
	That's described <a
		href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Start a command window,
	then
	download learn like so:
<pre>
    git  clone  https://github.com/goblimey/learn-unix
</pre>
That creates a directory called learn-unix
containing the learn software.
</p>
<p>
	Change directory to learn-unix
	and build the software like so:
<pre>
    cd  learn-unix

    docker  build  .  -t  learnunix
</pre>
(That's docker space build space
dot space hyphen t space learnunix.)
</p>
<p>
	That last command will take a few minutes and display a running commentary.
	If all goes well, the last few lines
	should be something like:
<pre>
    Successfully built 446990c342ad
    Successfully tagged learnunix:latest
</pre>
<br>
The build was successful and produced a Docker image with ID 446990c342ad.
</p>
