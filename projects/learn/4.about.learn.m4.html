<h3>About the Learn Software</h3>

<p>
	Learn is a Computer-Based Teaching tool that gives basic training in using UNIX and Linux.
	(Linux is a version of UNIX.)
</p>

<p>
	The UNIX operating system was developed by computer science researchers
	at Bell Laboratories
	in the 1970s
	and became available outside Bell in the 1980s.
	Within Bell it was used by all sorts of people.
	This was before the advent of personal computers and
	some of the users had little or no experience of computers.
	Mike Lesk and Brian Kernighan created the learn system
	to explain how to use computers in general and UNIX in particular.
</p>
<p>
	The lessons in learn reflect the state of computing in the late 1970's,
	in particular the command-line interface that was used in those days.
	You see a prompt, you type a command,
	it runs and produces a result,
	you see another prompt,
	and so on.
	These days we all use very powerful desktop or laptop computers.
	Point and click window-based operating systems
	such as Microsoft Windows
	have replaced the old command-line interfaces
	and interactive screen-based word processors
	have replaced the very primitive text editors
	of the 1970's.
	The learn system became redundant and fell out of use.
	Later versions of UNIX didn't even include it.
</p>
<p>The learn software is not strictly open-source in the conventional sense.
	The material is copyright AT&T, but a note in the source code gives permission for fairly free use.
	For the precise conditions, see the file LICENSE or any of the C source files.
</p>
<p>
	Early versions of UNIX
	needed a fairly expensive computer to run
	and it was licensed -
	companies using it had to pay
	a license fee to use it.
	Then,
	personal computers became powerful enough
	to run UNIX and free versions emerged,
	notably Linux.
</p>
<p>
	The learn software was originally included in
	version 7 UNIX which was released in 1978.
	The software and the lessons
	were not reworked as UNIX developed
	and they became increasingly out of date.
	Later versions of UNIX didn't even
	include the learn software.
	The C source code was preserved by the OpenBSD
	group,
	but C itself had changed
	and the learn system no longer even compiled.
</p>
<p>
	In 2002 I applied some simple changes
	to make learn work again
	and later released the result on Github,
	but there was still a chicken and egg problem.
	Learn is aimed at people
	who don't know anything about UNIX,
	but they needed to know enough
	to build and
	install learn,
	and they needed
	a computer running UNIX
	to run it on.
	That was OK if they owned an Apple Mac,
	but the majority only had
	a machine running Microsoft Windows.
	In any case,
	Linux also now offered
	a point-and-click windowing interface,
	so you could use it without knowing anything
	about the command-line interface.
</p>
<p>
	With the growth of Virtual Private Server (VPS) systems AKA cloud computing,
	the situation has changed again.
	A large computer system can now be made up of hundreds
	or even thousands
	of low-powered <b><i>virtual computers</i></b>.
	(Virtual meaning that one very powerful computer
	simulates (pretends to be) many small computers.)
	Typically these virtual computers exist in some remote data Centre
	and are used as
	<b><i>servers</i></b>
	(computers providing some service over a network).
	The companies that use them rent them by the month or sometimes by the second,
	controlling them via the Internet.
	I run my web server on a virtual server rented from
	Digital Ocean
	and it costs me $5 per month.
</p>
<p>
	If you build your system out of a few hundred virtual computers,
	you don't want to pay for a few hundred operating system licences.
	Being free, Linux has become one of the operating system of choice
	for cloud computing.

</p>
<p>
	We use cloud servers because they are cheap,
	and the cheapest way to access them is via a command-line interface
	rather than a point-and-click windowing system.
	So we are now back where we were
	in the late 1970's,
	controlling a low-powered computer
	by typing a command, waiting for it to finish
	and then typing another.
	Generations of techies who are used to running
	Microsoft Windows systems
	via a nice point-and-click interface
	now have to get their heads around
	running cloud-based Linux systems
	via a command-line interface.
</p>
<p>
	Hmm.
	We used to have a piece of software
	that helped people do that.
	It was called "learn".
	Trouble is,
	it's not included by default
	in Linux systems anymore,
	and in any case,
	most of the people who could benefit from it
	only know how to use
	Microsoft Windows,
	so ideally learn
	should run under that.
</p>
<p>
	The solution is, again,
	virtual computing.
	From Windows version 10 onwards
	a laptop running Windows Home
	can also simulate several virtual computers
	using the <b><i>Docker</i></b> software
	which offers <b><i>containerisation</i></b>.
	It allows you to package up a complete computer system -
	operating system and application software -
	and run the whole thing in a virtual computer
	within a Microsoft Windows system.
	So, I can provide a complete ready-made Linux system
	with the learn software installed
	that you can run on your Windows machine
	in a Docker container.
	Once you've used learn to teach you the basics
	you can use the same Linux container
	to experiment and go further.
</p>




<p>
	Now over forty years old,
	the learn software looks a little clunky
	compared to modern computer-based training systems.
	Its power as a teaching tools
	comes from the fact that
	it drives the user
	through a series of exercises using UNIX commands
	on a real UNIX system.
