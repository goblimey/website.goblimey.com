<h2>Installing Learn on an Apple Mac</h2>


<p>
	You need to install Docker and git.
</p>

	<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04/">installing
		Docker</a>
</p>
<p>
	Start a command window.
</p>
<p>
	If docker is installed but not active (started) this command will start it:
	<br>
<pre>
	sudo systemctl start docker
</pre>
<br>
This should only be necessary once.
When you reboot,
Docker should start automatically.
</p>

<p>
	Download learn like so:
<pre>
    git  clone  https://github.com/goblimey/learn-unix
</pre>
That creates a directory called learn-unix
containing the learn software.
</p>
<p>
	Change directory to learn-unix
	and build the software like so:
<pre>
    cd  learn-unix

    docker  build  .  -t  learnunix
</pre>
(That's docker space build space
dot space hyphen t space learnunix.)
</p>
<p>
	That last command will take a few minutes and display a running commentary.
	If all goes well, the last few lines
	should be something like:
<pre>
    Successfully built 446990c342ad
    Successfully tagged learnunix:latest
</pre>
<br>
The build was successful and produced a Docker image with ID 446990c342ad.
</p>
