<h1>The Goblimey Scaffolder</h1>
<h2>2.2 The JSON Specification</h2>
<p>
	The scaffolder is driven by a text file in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format
	that specifies a database and a set of tables.
	JSON is described <a href='http://www.json.org'>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	When you are writing JSON, it's very easy to make a simple mistake such as missing out a comma.
	The scaffolder uses an off-the-shelf JSON processor and the error messages it produces are not very helpful.
	You will save yourself a lot of pain if you prepare the file
	using an editor that understands JSON and warns you about obvious errors.
	Most Integrated development Environments (liteIDE, Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode etc) have editors that will do this.
	Some text editors including Windows Notepad++ also understand JSON.
</p>
<p>
	The scaffolder includes an example specification file so you can use that for a quick experiment.
	Copy goprojects/scaffolder/examples/animals.scaffold.json into your project directory and rename it scaffold.json.
</p>
<p>
	That specification defines a MySQL database called "animals" containing tables "cats" and "mice":
</p>
<pre><code>
    {
        "name": "animals",
        "db": "mysql",
        "dbuser": "webuser",
        "dbpassword": "secret",
        "dbserver": "localhost",
        "orm": "gorp",
        "sourcebase": "github.com/alunsmithie/animals",
        "Resources": [
            {
                "name": "cat",
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "name", "type": "string", "mandatory": true,
                        "testValues": ["a","b"]
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "breed", "type": "string", "mandatory": true
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "age", "type": "int", "mandatory": true,
                        "excludeFromDisplay": true
                    },
                   {
                        "name": "weight", "type": "float", "mandatory": true,
                        "excludeFromDisplay": true
                    },
		    {
                        "name": "chipped", "type": "bool",
                        "excludeFromDisplay": true
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "mouse", "plural": "mice",
                "fields": [
                    { "name": "name", "type": "string", "mandatory": true },
                    { "name": "breed", "type": "string", "excludeFromDisplay": true }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
	</code></pre>
<p>
	As the JSON website explains, JSON is built on two structures:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A collection of name/value pairs.</li>
	<li>An ordered list of values (AKA an array).</li>
</ol>
<p>
	For example in the first line above "name": "animals" is a pair with name "name" and value "animals". It defines the
	name of the resulting go project and the database table that it controls.
	The value can be a strings of text, a number, a boolean value (true or false) and so on.
</p>
<p>
	A JSON list is enclosed in brackets, for example
</p>
<p>
	"testValues": ["a","b"]
</p>
<p>
	That defines a list called "testValues" which contains strings of text.
</p>
<p>
	The Resources section is a more complicated list, containing a sub-hierarchy of pairs.
</p>
<p>
	As far as the scaffolder is concerned, each resource section in the JSON specification
	defines a database table, a model with an associated repository, a controller and a set of views.
</p>
<p>
	In the example, the first few lines of the JSON define the database. It's the one we created earlier, a MySQL
	database called "animals" accessed using the user name "webuser" and the password "secret".
	"localhost" means that the MySQL server is running on this computer and listening on the default port. (You can
	specify the port like so: "dbport": "1234".)
</p>
<p>
	The ORM pair says which ORM to use. At present
	the only one supported is <a href='https://github.com/coopernurse/gorp'>(GORP)</a> version 1.
	I plan to add support for other ORMs in the future.
</p>
<p>
	The sourcebase says where the generated source code should be stored within the project. This should follow the Go
	package layout conventions.
	In this example the project will stored in the github repository http://github.com/alunsmithie/animals, so the
	sourcebase value is "github.com/alunsmithie/animals". Given that, the scaffolder creates material in
	src/github.com/alunsmithie/animals within the go workspace directory.
</p>
<p>
	Next comes the Resources section, which is a JSON list.
	Each entry describes a resource with an associated database table,
	This example describes the "cat" resource handling the "cats" table and the "mouse" resource handling the "mice"
	table.
</p>
<p>
	Traditionally, database tables are named using the plural of the data that they contain.
	If that's just the singular with an "s" added, you don't need to specify it.
	The plural of "mouse" is "mice" so you have to define that in the JSON.
</p>
<p>
	"name": "mouse", "plural": "mice",
</p>
<p>
	Each resource section defines a list of fields. The cat resource has fields "name" and "breed" which contain strings
	of text,
	"age" containing an integer (a whole number)
	"weight" containing a floating point number (one with a fractional part)
	and "chipped" containing a boolean value (true or false)
	recording whether or not the cat has been microchipped.
	All fields but the last are mandatory.
	The mouse resource has just two fields.
</p>
<p>
	The scaffolder generates a set of unit and integration test programs to check that the generated source code works
	properly.
	A unit test takes a module of the source code and runs it in isolation, supplying it with test values and checking
	that the module produces the expected result. An integration tests is similar, but tests that a set of modules work
	together properly.
	Each field in the JSON can have a list of testValues to be used by the tests.
	This is optional. If you don't specify test values, they are generated automatically.
	If you don't specify enough values, the rest are generated automatically.
	Currently none of the the generated tests use more than two values,
	so a list of two values is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
	The optional excludeFromDisplay value in the JSON
	controls a display label which is used to identify each database record on the generated web pages.
	For example in the cats resource the fields "age", "weight" and "chipped" are excluded
	from the display label, leaving the ID, name and breed fields.
	So if Tommy the Siamese cat is described by record 42 in the cats table the display label for that record will be:
</p>
<pre><code>
    42 Tommy Siamese   
	</code></pre>
<p>
	The display label is used for various purposes.
	For example, the index page for a resource shows a list of display labels,
	one for each record.
</p>

<p>
	The display label is also used to create the title of the page that displays a single record
	(the Show page) and the one that allows you to change the data in the record (the Edit page).
	Within the HTML the label also used to create the IDs of the document fields to aid automated testing tools such as
	Selenium.
</p>
<p>
	By default the display label contains the value of every field in the record.
	That can be a lot more information than you want and often just a few fields are enough.
</p>
<p>
	The tables are created by GORP the first time you run the web server.
	Each table has the fields specified in the JSON, plus an auto-incremented unique numeric ID.
	The cats table will look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
    mysql> describe cats;
    +---------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field   | Type                | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +---------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | id      | bigint(20) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | name    | varchar(255)        | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | breed   | varchar(255)        | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | age     | bigint(20)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | weight  | double              | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | chipped | tinyint(1)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    +---------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
	</code></pre>
<p>
	The ID field is an auto-incremented unique integer.
	When you create a record you don't have to set it.
	The first record will have ID 1, the next ID 2 and so on.
	The rest of the fields are as specified in the JSON.
