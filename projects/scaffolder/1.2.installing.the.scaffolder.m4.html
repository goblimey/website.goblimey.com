<h1>The Goblimey Scaffolder</h1>
<h2>1.2 Installing the Scaffolder</h2>
<p>
	This section assumes that you have set up your environment variables
	<b>PATH</b> and <b>GOPATH</b> as described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>
	The scaffolder
	needs various bits and pieces of ready-made Go software,
	so download those first.
</p>

<p>
	You need to use a command window to do this.
	(Under Windows 7 use the <b>Command Prompt</b> option in the Start menu
	to start a command window.)
</p>
<p>
	Run these commands:
</p>
<pre><code>
    go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
    go get gopkg.in/gorp.v1
    go get github.com/emicklei/go-restful
    go get github.com/petergtz/pegomock/pegomock
    go get github.com/goblimey/scaffolder
	</code></pre>
<p>
	Those commands download ready-made Go projects onto your computer
	including the scaffolder.
	Your <b>GOPATH</b> variable says where they will be stored.
	In my case that's "/home/simon/goprojects".
</p>
<p>
	Note: by default, "go get" doesn't update any projects that you have already downloaded.
	If you downloaded any of those projects a long time ago,
	you may wish to update them to the latest version using the -u flag, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>
    go get -u github.com/petergtz/pegomock/pegomock
    </code></pre>
<p>
	If I run the first of those "go get" commands on Linux,
	it creates a directory /home/simon/goprojects/src/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
	containing some files.
	This is the source material for a MySQL driver.
	The command also creates a file
	/home/simon/goprojects/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.a
	containing a built version of this driver ready to run on the AMD processor of my PC under Linux.
</p>
<p>
	The fourth "go get" command downloads the pegomock tool and creates a directory
	/home/simon/goprojects/bin containing the resulting executable (AKA "binary") program.
	Whenever you use "go get" to download a Go project that produces an executable program,
	this is where the built result will be stored.
</p>
<p>
	The final command in the list builds the scaffolder
	and puts the resulting executable program in the goprojects bin directory.
</p>
<p>
	Your <b>PATH</b> environment variable contains a list of directories, each of which
	should contain executable programs.
	If you type the name of a program that's in one of those directories,
	the system will find it and run it.
	You added the goprojects bin directory to your path earlier,
	so once you have installed the scaffolder,
	you can run it like so:
</p>
<pre><code>
	$ scaffolder
	</code></pre>
<p>
	Don't do that just yet, you need to create a configuration file first.
