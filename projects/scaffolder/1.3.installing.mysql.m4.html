<h1>The Goblimey Scaffolder</h1>
<h2>1.3 Installing MySQL</h2>
<p>
	The server produced by the scaffolder expects to access a database.
	At present it only supports MySQL,
	which is free and provides a relational database server.
	Download it from <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/'>here</a>.
	You need the community server and the tools.
	The tools work from a command window, so
	you might also find the workbench useful.
	The workbench provides a visual interface to manage your databases.
</p>
<p>
	If you use the standard installation, the MySQL server will start up automatically and run in the background.
</p>
<p>
	Once MySQL is installed, create a database.
	To do this using the command-line tools, start a command window
	(On Windows 7 use the Command Prompt option in the Start menu)
	and use the MySQL client.
	In this example I create a database called "animals" that can be accessed by the MySQL user "webuser" using the
	password "secret":
</p>
<code>
		mysql -u root -p
		{type the root password that you set when you installed mysql}
		mysql> create database animals;
	    mysql> grant all on animals.* to 'webuser' identified by 'secret';
	    mysql> quit
	</code>
<p>
	The user has all access rights, so it can create tables.
	The web server generated by the scaffolder
	can be configured to connect to this database as this user.
