	<h2>The Goblimey Scaffolder</h2>
	<p>
		Given a description of a database and its tables, the Goblimey Scaffolder creates that database
		and generates a web server which provides the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations
		on it.
	</p>
	<p>
		These notes are aimed at readers who are new to programming,
		so they are very detailed and go at a fairly slow pace.  
		There's a much faster introduction
		<a href='https://github.com/goblimey/scaffolder'>here</a> 
		which is aimed at more experienced readers. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The scaffolder is written in the Go programming language, 
		as is the web server that it produces.
		The server is designed according to the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture and is
		implemented using RESTful requests.  (Those buzzwords are explained in more detail later.)
		The result is presented as a complete prototype Go project with all source code included
		along with unit and integration tests to check that the whole thing hangs together.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea of the scaffolder is taken from the Ruby-on-Rails scaffold generator.
	</p>
	<p>
		Producing the right design for the database that sits behind a web site usually takes several attempts.
		The scaffolder gives you a quick and easy way to create databases, put data into them and experiment with different versions.
		Once you have a working version, you can extend the source code and produce your own production web server.
		That's much easier than producing one from scratch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Producing a complete piece of working source code also makes the scaffolder
		a very useful aid to learning Go.
		That means that it may be used by people who are new to Go and
		possibly new to programming,
		so this document doesn't assume extensive knowledge of Go or the Go tools.
		That makes it a bit longer and more complicated than it would otherwise need to be,
		but readers can just skip the parts that they understand.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some readers will be using a computer which is running Microsoft Windows.
		Many people (including me) think that Windows is not the best operating system
		to use for software development, and many Go developers use a Linux machine or an Apple Mac.
		However, if Windows is the only system you know, it's perfectly adequate.
