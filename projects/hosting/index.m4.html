	<h2>Internet Services for Small Organisations</h2>
	<p>
		This document is aimed at small organisation such as local societies
		and small companies,
		and explains
		how to
		set up your own Internet servers.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>server</b> is just a computer connected to the Internet
		with a published name.
		Internet services run on servers.
		Your organisation may be already using Internet servers,
		running on somebody else's infrastructure.
		Companies that build websites often provide the servers that run them.
		This tends to be expensive and restrictive,
		and if the website company goes out of business,
		potentially disastrous.
	<p>
		It's quite cheap these days to run your own servers
		on the Internet,
		and fairly easy.
		There's lots of help out there telling you how to do it.
		The problem is that the help is scattered across a lot of places
		and each document assumes lots of specialist knowledge.
		This document aims to show the whole process from start to finish.
	</p>

	<p>
		I mention a number of companies here, notably Ionos, Namecheap and Digital Ocean. 
		My only commercial relationship with them is as a customer.
		If you follow the advice here and buy their services,
		I gain no benefit.
		Other similar services are available elsewhere
		and you can do your own research to find them.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you'll see pretty soon,
		your server runs an operating system called Linux.
		If you've not used Linux before,
		I can offer some help.
		Once you've created your server
		you will find some free training software 
		On my github page
		<a href='https://github.com/goblimey/learn-unix'>here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nerds like me distinguish between <b>The Internet</b>
		which is a network of computers offering services of all sorts,
		and <b>The World-Wide Web</b>
		which is all of the web servers
		connected to that network.
		To put that another way,
		the Internet has web servers connected to it,
		but it has lots of other stuff as well -
		mail servers for example.
	</p>
	<h3>The Domain Name Service</h3>
	<p>
		You need to know a little about
		the Domain Name Service (DNS),
		which gives names to computers on the Internet.
		When you send email to john.smith@gmail.com,
		the DNS system tells your email client which email server to send it to.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's some more jargon.
		A <b>client</b> is a piece of software (a program)
		running on the computer on your desk or in your hand (your <b>local machine</b>)
		that connects across a network to a server to access whatever service
		that server offers.
		A web browser is a client,
		because it fetches web pages from web servers.
		</p>
		<p>
		If your local machine is a smartphone,
		the client is called an <b>app</b> 
		(short for application software)
		That's just a program by another name. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Strictly, you don't buy a domain,
		you rent it via one of many DNS providers.
		The sense in which you own it
		is that
		as long as you keep paying the annual renewal fees,
		nobody can take it from you.
		Also
		you can sell it to somebody else.
		Essentially you have a lease entitling you to use the domain,
		you have first refusal when it's due for renewal
		and you can sell it to somebody else.
		If you don't pay the rent,
		you lose the lease.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Only one organisation can use a particular domain.
		Ideally you want a short domain name that matches your organisation's name.
		If you are setting up a new organisation,
		I suggest finding a suitable domain name that nobody has already bought,
		then naming the organisation after it.
		Buying a new domain is cheap - 
		$20 per year or less.
		Back in the 1990's, a few people made a lot of money by buying
		domains and then selling them on.
		As a result
		if you choose any word in the dictionaries of several languages
		and add ".com",
		that domain
		has already been bought by somebody,
		and they will try to charge you a lot of money for it.
		This is why we have websites with names like zettle.com and shopify.com - 
		nobody else had thought of buying those names.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For a profit-making business, it's best to own a .com domain.
		A non-profit organisation can use a .org domain.
		Those are the main "international" domains.
		You have as much right to use them as anybody else.
		There are also equivalents for each country -
		here in the UK we have .co.uk and .org.uk domains. 
		The problem with those is, people easily
		get confused.
		If you own the domain birdwatchers.org.uk
		and somebody else owns birdwatchers.org
		or birdwatcher.com,
		they will probably receive emails meant for you
		but not vice versa,
		Owning a .com or .org domains is always better.
		For similar reasons,
		if you buy a .org domain,
		it's best if you can buy the .com domain as well,
		if only to stop anybody else using it.
	</p>
	<p>
		You have to be creative and flexible when choosing a domain name.
		Don't do it in a hurry.
		I wanted to set up an organisation called Accurate Location,
		so I wanted to buy the domains accuratelocation.org and
		accuratelocation.com.
		Somebody else had already bought them
		but accurateposition.org and accurateposition.com
		were available.
		I bought them and set up an organisation called Accurate Position.
	</p>
	<p>
		To find out if a domain is available,
		go to your DNS provider's website and try to buy it.
		The first thing it does is to tell you if it's already taken
		and if it is,
		whether it's for sale.
		(If it's for sale and you can't easily see the price,
		this is probably the time to try another choice of name.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Most DNS providers also provide hosting.
		If you follow the advice here,
		you will provide your own hosting.
		You need a DNS provider
		that allows you to do that.
		If you've already bought your domain and your DNS provider
		only allows you to use their hosting,
		you can transfer the domain to another provider for a small fee.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout the rest of
		this document, I will assume that you own the domain <b>example.com</b>
		and you have full control over it.
		Wherever you see "example.com" below,
		replace that with the name of your domain.
	</p>
	<p>
		Domain names are hierarchical.
		"com", "org" and "uk" are top-level domains.
		The domain example.com is a sub-domain of com.
		If you own it
		you can create further subdomains www.example.com,
		mail.example.com, and so on.
		There are some conventions
		but the subdomain names are your choice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of your servers should have at least one name,
		but it can have more - one server could be called
		example.com, www.example.com and so on. 
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two common situations.
		One is that you are starting from scratch.
		You want to buy a domain and create a web server
		to house your website.
		You also want to send and receive email,
		so you need a mail server.
		To achieve all that, you buy the domain example.com (or whatever)
		and create subdomains www.example.com and mail.example.com.
		You call the machine running your web service
		"example.com" and "www.example.com". 
		You call the machine running your mail service "mail.example.com".
		(You can call them whatever you like
		as long as the name ends with ".example.com".
		Those are the common conventions.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The other common situation is that 
		your web design company has bought the domain name for you
		and they control the domain records.
		This is VERY BAD
		because your entire public image depends on some other organisation
		staying in business and you have no control over them.
		You should get an account with a domain name service
		and demand that the supplier releases the domain into your control.
		It's safe to let them provide hosting for your website,
		but only once you have control of the domain records.
	</p>
	<h3>Hosting</h3>
	<p>
		A hosting service provides computers on the Internet for rent
		on which you can run your web server, email server or whatever.
		(Another potential confusion:
		the word <b>server</b> can mean a computer offering a service
		or the piece of software running on the computer
		which provides that service.
		Once you understand that,
		it's usually obvious which is meant from the context.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Most DNS providers offer hosting,
		but the facilities are usually limited.
		This document assumes that you are going to rent your own 
		"cloud" computer,
		with which you can do anything you like.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing worth knowing is that
		these computers that you are going to rent
		are not real.
		As you will see, you can magic them into existence
		in a minute or so and remove them again just as quickly,
		which is a clue.
		There isn't a little man somewhere running around
		setting up and tearing down equipment for you.
		What's really going on is that the hosting provider
		has rooms full of very big computers 
		which are pretending to be lots of smaller computers.
		What you are renting is a <b>virtual server</b>
		(or a <b>cloud server</b>,
		which is the same thing but sounds more impressive).
	</p>
		Lots of companies offer virtual servers,
		including the mighty Amazon.
		Digital Ocean offer a service which is especially suited
		to small organisations,
		and that's the one I use.
		They call their virtual computers "droplets".
		You can rent a droplet for as little as $5 per month
		and run a small website on it.
	<p>
		Just to ram an important difference home:
		your hosting service provides a rented
		virtual computer (a <b>machine</b>) connected to the Internet
		that you can use to provide services.
		Your DNS service tells the rest of the world
		where to find the machine that you're renting,
		so that they can access that service.
	</p>
	<h3>SSH Authentication Keys</h3>
	<p>
		To access your machine securely, you need ssh keys.
		These are just two plain text files stored on your local machine,
		one public and one private.
		They're called keys because your droplet will be locked
		and only somebody with the keys can get in.
		You need to set up some keys before you create your droplet.
		I believe that you can set up keys on a smartphone,
		but I never have.
		Here I assume that you are using a laptop or desktop computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you use a Mac
		<a href='https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-mac-os-x'>
			see this document</a>.
		If you use Windows, you will need to install some software
		as explained
		<a href='https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows'>
			here</a>.
		The Windows document suggests two options, PuTTY and Git Bash.
		I suggest you use the Git Bash option,
		and elsewhere in this document,
		I will assume that you have.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you take the defaults when you create your keys,
		they will be created in a directory called <b>.ssh</b> 
		in your home directory.
		You will produce files in there called
		<b>id_rsa</b> (your private key)
		and <b>id_rsa.pub</b> (your public key).
		You need to keep the contents of the private key file to yourself,
		but it's safe to let anyone see the contents of your public key.
		That's the essential idea - nobody else
		knows what's in your private key file
		but anybody can know what's in your public key file.
		The keys are password protected.
		You need to supply the password whenever you use them.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can choose another name when you create your keys. 
		For reasons that will become clear later,
		I suggest that you create two sets of keys.
		Use the default name for the first pair
		and for the second pair, 
		set the name to <b>id_rsa_root</b>.
		You will end up with four key files <b>id_rsa</b>,
		<b>id_rsa.pub</b>, <b>id_rsa_root</b> and <b>id_rsa_root.pub</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you will see, you will need these keys when you create your server.
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		The files are actually encryption keys.
		If you take a piece of text and encrypt it using your private key,
		somebody else can decrypt it if they have the matching public key.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the keys to verify your identity.
		It goes something like this:
		We meet up and you give me a copy of your public key file.
		We agree a piece of text,
		say "Abracadabra".
		This text is called <b>the challenge</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, you want to send me an email
		which is guaranteed to come from you and not some imposter.
		You encrypt the agreed challenge with your private key and put the result
		in the email.
		The encrypted version is a pile of unreadable junk.
		If I can decrypt that unreadable junk
		with your public key and the result is "Abracadabra",
		then I know that it was you that sent the email.
		Only your private key can produce the unreadable junk that,
		when decrypted, produces the challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
		Strictly, I know that it was somebody 
		who has the private key that matches 
		the public key that you gave me,
		which is why you need to keep the contents of
		your private key to yourself.
		Oh, and we had to meet up beforehand
		so that I know that it was really you that gave me the public key.
		That's called "the key distribution problem."
	</p>
	<p>
		The same principle can be used to log in from the computer on your desk
		(the <b>local machine</b>)
		across the Internet
		to the computer you are renting from the hosting company
		(the <b>remote machine</b>).
		As we will see later,
		when you set up your remote machine,
		you supply your public key.
		It goes something likje this:
		when you try to log into it from your local computer,
		behind the scenes
		the two ends agree a challenge.
		Your local computer encrypts the challenge
		using your private key and sends the result
		across the Internet to the remote machine.
		The remote machine decrypts what it receives and 
		checks that the decrypted version matches the agreed challenge.
		If so, it lets you log in. 
		You still have to supply a password to open your key,
		but it's not sent across the network.
		The Internet is public medium
		and various people could be monitoring the traffic,
		but they can't use what they can see to masquerade as you
		and log in to your server.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As some people read this section, I can hear them say
		"This all sounds very complicated.  Why can't I just use a password?"
		We'll see later why that would be a very bad idea.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Buying Your Domain</h3>
	<p>
		I use a DNS service called <a href='https://ionos.com'>ionos.com</a>,
		which is very easy to use but a little more expensive than some.
		I've also used <a href='https://www.namecheap.com/'>namecheap.com</a>,
		which is cheaper,
		but has a user interface that's a little more cranky.
		Many other DNS services are available.
	</p>
	<p>
		(One thing about the Ionos service is cranky:
		if you go to the website www.ionos.com
		to buy a domain
		and their system detects that
		you are not in the USA,
		it will redirect your web browser to a regional website,
		in my case the UK site www.ionos.co.uk.
		Confusingly,
		the regional website holds your account,
		and www.ionos.com knows nothing about it.
		If you go back later to www.ionos.com and try to log in
		using the user name and password that you set up
		on your first visit,
		it won't recognise you.
		You have to go to your regional site
		and log in to that.)
	<p>
		Fees for domains vary between DNS providers.
		Beware of "special offers" on new domains.
		Check the renewal fees before buying.
		It may be cheaper in the long run to go elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you don't already own your domain,
		choose a provider and buy it now.
	</p>
	</p>
		<p>
		Once you've figured that out and logged in,
		the Ionos user interface is fairly straightforward.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Setting up Your Host Machine</h3>
	<p>
		Your host machine is a rented virtual computer somewhere in the cloud.
		Many companies offer them.
		If you want to do research,
		type "cheap hosting services" into a search engine.

	</p>
	<p>
		I've found the Digital Ocean service 
		fairly cost effective for small organisations.
		They offer machines starting at 1 GB of memory.
		For many services,
		including a web server,
		that's ample,
		in fact you could run several services on that one server.
		For the rest of this document
		I'm assuming that you will use that service.
		If not, the same general ideas should apply.
		(The key thing is to create a server,
		find out its IP addresses
		and then go back to your DNS provider's website
		and set up your domain records.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Digital Ocean have a customer referral scheme
		which can save you a bit of money.
		Find out about that
		<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/referral-program">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>

		If you are happy to be referred to Digital Ocean by me, then
	follow
		<a href='https://m.do.co/c/2ad0930c6d6b'>this link</a>
		and create your account.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	If you don't approve of that sort of thing
	but you still want to use Digital Ocean service,
	follow <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">this link</a>
	which lets you open an account without using the
	referral scheme.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've opened your Digital Ocean account,
		hit the Create button at the top of the page
		and choose Droplets. 
		You see a page with lots of options.
		I suggest:
		<ul>
			<li>If you are familiar with Linux, use your favourite version.
				If not, Debian is a good choice.
			</li>
			<li>The basic plan.</li>
			<li>For the CPU option, Regular Intel with SSD (Solid State Disk).</li>
			<li>The $5 per month option, which gives 1 GB of memory OR</li>
			<li>the $10 per month option, which gives 2 GB of memory.</li>
			<li>The data Centre nearest to you.</li>
			<li>IP V6</li>
			<li>Authentication using SSH keys - see below</li>
			<li>one droplet (the default)</li>
			<li>your host name - example.com or whatever</li>
			<li>optional but very useful: the $2 per month backup service</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you choose authentication by SSH keys,
		you will need to upload your public key file
		id_rsa_root.pub from your computer.  
		It's in the .ssh directory in your home directory.
		You need to do this for your first droplet.
		If you create another, it will use the same key by default.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a web server,
		set the hostname to your domain name - "example.com" or whatever.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose the optional backup service,
		your machine will be backed up once per week,
		so in the event of a disaster,
		you can recover quickly,
		and lose only the last few days of changes.
		For a website, that's not too bad.
		(You are keeping change records, aren't you?)
		but you may also want to arrange an alternative form of backup
		that happens more frequently.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your droplet
		has a version 4 IP address and a version 6 IP address.
		These
		identify it on the Internet.
		They act like a phone number - 
		if you know one of the addresses,
		you can access the droplet's services.
		The DNS service acts like a phone book - 
		it translates a readable name such as example.com 
		into an IP address.
	</p>
	<p>
		Go to the Droplets menu on the left of the user interface page,
		click on the droplet name and the resulting details page
		shows both addresses.
		You'll need them later to set up the DNS records.  
	</p>
	<p>
		It's easy to get some of the details wrong when you create your droplet.
		If so,
		you can just use the same web page to destroy it
		and start again.
		Don't continue until you have everything correct.
	</p>
	<h3>Setting up the DNS</h3>
	<p>
		Now you have a host machine ready to run your website
		and you know its version 4 and version 6 IP addresses.
		Go back to your DNS provider's website
		and set up some name records.
		This is probably the most difficult part.
		There's nothing mind-taxing about it,
		it's just messy.
		All the providers' websites do the same thing,
		but they all do it in different ways
		and each has its own special wrinkles.
		Don't expect to do this stage in a hurry
		the first time.
	</p>
	<p>
		You need to create:
		<ul>
			<li>an AAAA record for example.com containing the version 6 IP address of your droplet (the long address).</li>
			<li>an A record for example.com containing the version 4 IP address</li>
			<li>if you are creating a web server, a CNAME record called "www" (ie www.example.com),</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you're setting up the records,
		there's a common convention that "@" refers to your main domain
		"example.com"
		and a name such as "www" refers to a subdomain called "www.example.com".
		If you're using Namecheap you are forced follow that convention - 
		in the setup pages on their web site "www" means "www.example.com,
		To set up records for example.com itself, you need to call it "@".
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is a screenshot of the Advanced DNS page on the namecheap website
		showing the DNS records for my domain
		accurateposition.org.
		The domain name is at the top of the page.  In the records section,
		"@" in the Host column represents the domain name.
		"www" represents the subdomain www.accurateposition.org.
		The A record defines the version 4 IP address of the server, 161.35.36.4,
		the AAAA record defines the longer version 6 IP address
		and the CNAME record defines www.accurateposition.org to be
		another name for accurateposition.org.
		(The IP addresses are decided by your hosting company,
		as shown later.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The TTL column is the time to live.
		When somebody visits this website for the first time,
		their computer goes to the Namecheap
		name server to find the IP address of the server that's hosting it and
		it remembers that address for the time to live period,
		which may be hours or days.
		After that time,
		if they visit the website again,
		then behind the scenes their computer will look up the address again
		in case it's changed.
		If you change the IP address,
		for example because you move the site to a new hosting service,
		there will be cutover period during which some visitors will go to the old address
		and some will go to the new,
		so you need to keep both servers running for a few days
		until the requests to the old one dry up.
	</p>

	responsiveImage(/images/domain)
	<p>
		When I said earlier that a domain name or subdomain name "refers"
		to a server,
		this is what I mean.
		There's an DNS A record with that name
		containing the version 4 IP address of the server
		and a DNS AAAA record containing the version 6 IP address
		(or there's a CNAME record referring to the name
		in those records).
		If a client wants to send a request to a named server,
		the DNS system takes the name and gives back the IP addresses.
		The IP addresses tell a client computer where to send the request.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are using Ionos:
		<ul>
		<li>
		navigate from your home page to 
		the page for your domain and
		use the Adjust DNS Settings option at the bottom.
		</li>
		<li>
		Ionos may have already set up
		your domain to use their hosting service.
		When you set up your own records,
		you will get a warning that the service is being disabled.
		That's OK.</li>
		<li>
		Once you've created the records for the domain,
		use the "subdomain" option at the top of the page to create "www". 
		That subdomain then has its own control page.
		Navigate through the menus to that
		to create the A and AAAA records for the subdomain.
	</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Whichever DNS provider you use,
		their user interface will probably be something like the above,
		but with some interesting arbitrary differences.
		They all have help desks that will advise you if you get into difficulties,
		but you may be stuck for a day waiting for the answer. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Once I've set those records up, I can use the dig command 
		on my local computer to see the result.
		(On a Windows machine, do this via a git bash window.)

	<p>
		In the command window, type:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>
			ping example.com
		</pre>
	</p>
		<p>
		Hit the Enter key to run the command.
		If all is well
		you will see something like:
		<p><pre>
		PING example.com (179.127.152.235) 56(84) bytes of data.
		64 bytes from example.com (179.127.152.235): icmp_seq=1 ttl=50 time=11.9 ms
		64 bytes from example.com (179.127.152.235): icmp_seq=2 ttl=50 time=9.42 ms
		64 bytes from example.com (179.127.152.235): icmp_seq=3 ttl=50 time=10.1 ms
		64 bytes from example.com (179.127.152.235): icmp_seq=4 ttl=50 time=10.3 ms
	</pre></p>
		Each line of output shows the version 4 IP address 
		of your droplet.
		(You may have to hold down the control key and type a "c" to stop the
		command.)
	<p>
		If you get an error,
		or the command hangs,
		there's something wrong with the A or AAAA record that you set up.
	</p>
	<p>
		 If you set up a subdomain, check that it's also working:
	<p><pre>
		ping www.example.com
	</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Any problems with that, check the subdomain's records.
	</p>
	<h3>Connecting to Your Remote Machine</h3>
	<p>
		Once you've sorted out the DNS records, 
		you can log into your droplet and start work.
		Log in from your command window like so:
	</p>
	<p>
		On a Mac:
		<pre>
		sh root@example.com
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		On Windows, you have to help it along a bit:
		<pre>
		ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_root root@example.com
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you set up your key file
		you supplied a password.
		You have to supply that to continue.
		</p>
	<p>
		The first time you log in you will get this scary message:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>
		The authenticity of host 'example.com (179.138.177.235)' can't be established.
		ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:/FljgxBjsN2XYXWfF6ab6BnjrLY64+yXoiyIJZiQJac.
		Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Answer yes.
	</p>
	<p>
		So you've logged in to your droplet.
		What's to stop somebody else logging in?
	</p>
	<p>
		You're logged into the remote machine as a user called "root" 
		(the equivalent of the admin user on Windows).
		That user has a home directory
		containing a directory called ".ssh". 
		In there is a file called <b>authorized_keys</b>
		(American spelling).
		You can display the contents like so:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>
		cat .ssh/authorized_keys
		ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABZGHBAQDESnHZ02ZJooRGGFSz9XV1aqJq6BkNpadxf7eHi2hLOGEUdxWoC/td7Hhs42gUC8f7EzPpCbYOEaS0b4vwA53m2bkx9+FmkqpJxX2l8QJ2QYNcjrbW2CgSIBS3gIKreBPxVhTd5Ue+ZZJYoLLJcCWGNohwtkaxOFpBCI0hgkTtA658YCCP1Ps2EGjmabXkmktm2wx41x1ZzvUnDmSJxPg1YuKCHpTjtvB6AnhnJYAJvi/QHNPpDfOlMMbH3JJ4aLfuyyXyQlGDIKHxcM4f7f2SdZIp74lcopi62mcDmHccHM0doF13B9QYLyz15VkMJoPVBfNNjeaFUSNBAPjFP+09
		</pre>
	</p>
		<p>
			The key is one long line.
			The authorized_keys file can contain many keys, one per line.
		</p>
	<p>
		That key matches the contents of the public key file
		<b>id_rsa_root.pub</b> on your computer.
		When you set up your droplet,
		you lodged a copy of your public key with the Digital Ocean user interface.
		When it creates a droplet for you, 
		it sets up an account called root with a .ssh directory
		and an authorized_keys file
		containing your public key.
		So, when you try to connect,
		the droplet knows that it's you.
	</p>

	<p>
		(To be pedantic,
		the droplet doesn't know that it's you connecting.
		It knows that somebody opened a password-protected account with Digital Ocean
		and supplied a valid 
		credit card to pay for droplet rental.
		It knows that somebody then logged into that account,
		created a droplet and supplied a public key that
		the droplet uses
		to authenticate incoming connections.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The root account on your droplet doesn't have a password,
		so it's not possible to log in that way.
		The only way to log in is
		to have a private key in the .ssh directory in your home directory
		on your local computer that matches one of the public keys
		in root's authorized_keys file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having only one person able to 
		control a computer which is vital to your organisation is obviously
		not a great idea.
		This mechanism allows you to allow other trusted people in.
		They create their own key pair and send you their public key.
		You log in and add it to the authorized_keys file.
		They can log in as root.
	</p>
	<p>
		Earlier I asked the question you may ask: 
		"This all sounds very complicated.  Why can't I just use a password?". 
		You can.
		When you create  droplet, you can just specify a password for the root user.
		Bad idea. 
	</p>
	<p>
		On your droplet, there's a file called auth.log which is a record of login attempts.
		You can see the most recent entries using the <b>tail</b> command like so:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>
	tail -100 /var/log/auth.log

	<p>
		Every few seconds somebody is attempting to log in
		by guessing a user name and password.
		Your machine is under attack!
	</p>
	<p>
		DNS records are public - they have to be - and these attacks started as soon
		as you created the A record announcing the existence of your machine.
		There's an automatic process running somewhere,
		probably several of them,
		trying all the time to break in.
		They guess likely user names and then guess passwords,
		starting with the obvious choices that lots of people are known to use - 
		"passw0rd", "secret123" and so on.
		If that doesn't work, they use brute force,
		trying all combinations of characters, one by one.
		However complicated you make your password,
		eventually one of these processes will guess it
		and the hacker can break in.
	</p>
	</p> 
		Once they are into the machine,
		they will take it over.
		If you're lucky, they will just delete all your files,
		or they might encrypt all your files and charge you 
		a ransom to decrypt them.
		(Whether they get round to doing the decryption is another matter.)
		Along the way, they may also harvest all the email addresses
		in incoming and outgoing mail,
		and sell them to other scammers.
		If you're very unlucky,
		they can use your machine to store illegal material 
		that they don't want on their own machine - terrorist manuals,
		child pornography, you name it.
		If the police find that stuff on your machine,
		your will have some explaining to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why doesn't somebody stop these people?
		If you take a look at the list again,
		each request comes from a different IP address,
		so a different computer.
		Whoever is doing this is using computers belonging to other people
		that they have already broken into.
		Whose computers are they using?
		They belong to those silly, silly people who said 
		"This authentication key stuff is all very complicated.  
		Why don't I just use a password?"

	<p>
		The root user is very useful for setting things up,
		but it has a very high level of privilege
		and a mistake can be disastrous.
		Next we create an ordinary user
		which we will use for normal work.
		Here I call that user <b>simon</b>. 
		When I showed how to create SSH keys earlier
		I suggested that you create two sets.
		The first set is for this user.
		The public key is called <b>id_rsa.pub</b>,
		the default.
		We want to create a user with no password
		and the contents of that public key in its <b>authorized_keys</b> file.
		Once logged in, it needs to be able to run docker.
	</p>
		<p>
			You need to get the command shown below exactly right,
			so if you're not used to Linux,
			copy and paste them.
			Note that pasting into a command window
			doesn't work the way you might expect.
			To paste, right-click anywhere in your command window and select Paste from the menu that appears.
		</p>
	<p>
		First, set the name of your user.  I'm going to call my user "simon".
	</p>
	<p>
<pre>
    user=simon
</pre>
That creates a variable containing the name of the user.
Change that line according to your needs.
You can then copy and paste the rest of these commands.
The text ${user} in the commands below is replaced automatically
by whatever word you set.
</p>
<pre>
useradd ${user} --create-home
usermod -L ${user}
mkdir /home/${user}/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/${user}/.ssh
chown -R ${user}:${user} /home/${user}/.ssh
usermod -aG docker ${user}
</pre>
Start a second command window on your computer and
set the user name again (It only works in one window).
Create another variable containg the name of your domain.
Then copy the public key into your user's .ssh directory and call it <b>authorized_keys</b>:
<pre>
	user=simon
	domain=example.com
</pre>
Then you can copy and paste this command:
<pre>
	scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@${domain}:/home/${user}/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
In my case
that would be the same as typing this:
<pre>
	scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@example.com:/home/simon/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
which means "take the file id_rsa.pub from the .ssh directory in my home directory
on this machine,
connect over the network to the machine called example.com as its user root,
copy my file to the .ssh directory in
the user simon's home directory and call it authorized_keys".
<p>
Back in your first command window 
(which is logged into the droplet as root)
change the ownership of the files you just created
so that they belong to your new user:
<pre>
    chown -R ${user}:${user} /home/${user}/.ssh
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now that you have the authorized_keys file set up,
you can now use your second command window
to log in as your new user:
<pre>
	ssh ${user}@${domain}
</pre>
	When you use ssh on a Windows system,
	it assumes that the private key is called
	id_rsa.
	In the example earlier the file had a different name and you had to help it along.
	Now you're using the default name,
	so the command works without help.
	On a Mac,
	the system figures out which is the correct key and uses that without help.
</p>
<p>
	Now you are logged into your server from two command
	windows.
	In one you are logged in as root, and one mistake there can be disastrous.
	In the other you are logged in as your ordinary user,
	which is much safer.
	You don't need root access now
	so disconnect that window -
	click on it, hold down the ctrl key and type 'd' just once - no enter key needed.
	The command window stays up,
	but it's no longer connected to the remote machine.
	any command you type in there runs on your local machine.  
</p>
<p>
	Having separate private keys for root access
	and your ordinary account is useful,
	especially if several people use the same accounts.
	You can control what they can do by giving them copies of different keys.
</p>

<p>
In the second window,
which is still logged in,
check that your ordinary account can run docker
by running the docker hello-world test container.
This just displays "Hello from Docker!"
along with lots of other stuff:
<pre>
	docker run hello-world
</pre>
That produces:
<pre>
	Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
	latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
	2db29710123e: Pull complete 
	Digest: sha256:37a0b92b08d4919615c3ee023f7ddb068d12b8387475d64c622ac30f45c29c51
	Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
	
	Hello from Docker!
	This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
	
	To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
	 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
	 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
		(amd64)
	 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
		executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
	 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
		to your terminal.
	
	To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
	 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
	
	Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
	 https://hub.docker.com/
	
	For more examples and ideas, visit:
	 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
</pre>
</p>
<p>
	You have a user which is safe to use -
	you can't wreck your system 
	by making a simple mistake.
	Your user can also run docker.
	As we'll see later,
	that makes it very easy to install services.
