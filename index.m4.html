			“Go (often referred to as golang) is a free and open source programming language 
			created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
			It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, 
			with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and 
			CSP-style concurrent programming features added.  
			The language was announced in November 2009; 
			it is used in some of Google's production systems, as well as by other firms.” Wikipedia.

			My <a href='https://github.com/goblimey'>GitHub page</a> 
			contains various things that I've written in Go,
			notably my Scaffolding tool,
			which produces an instant web server. 
		        The github page gives basic instructions
			on how to use the scaffolder,
			but some of the people who use it may be
			new to programming, let alone Go.
		        There is a much gentler introduction for them
