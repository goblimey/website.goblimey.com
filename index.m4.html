	“Go (often referred to as golang) is a free and open source programming language
	created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
	It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C,
	with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and
	CSP-style concurrent programming features added.
	The language was announced in November 2009;
	it is used in some of Google's production systems, as well as by other firms.” Wikipedia.

	My <a href='https://github.com/goblimey'>GitHub page</a>
	contains various things that I've written in Go.
	I'm particularly interested in accurate satellite
	positioning systems such as GPS
	and I've written software to support that.
	My github page contains
	<a href="https://github.com/goblimey/ntripcaster/">
		a dockerised version of the BKG NTRIP caster
	</a>
	and my
	<a href="https://github.com/goblimey/go-ntrip/">
		Go tools to support the NTRIP protocol
	</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Setting up services such as a simple web server
	or an NTRIP caster involves
	renting a virtual server and an Internet domain name for it.
	You can find notes on how to do that
	<a href="https://goblimey.com/projects/webserver/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	That involves setting up a server using
	the UNIX command line interface,
	which needs a knowledge of UNIX commands.
	I support some free computer-based training software
	that you can use to learn the basics of that.
